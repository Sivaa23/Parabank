## Usage
To use this project, clone it on your machine and open it on your favorite IDE.

To run the test automation, you can simply run all the tests located  at the `src\test\java\org.parasoft.arabank\TestCases\ParabankTest.java' dir. This is possible
because the ParaBank application is already running on a web server. 

Test cases also could be triggered by executing the test.xml file. Parallel execution is configured in the file hence all the tests will run parallelly
